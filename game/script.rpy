    Click on items in the fridge to look at what you have{p}and what items might have gone bad.

    How can you tell if something went bad?{p}By clicking on {b}Check{/b}!

    After clicking on an item, you can {b}Check{/b} on the item- looking at the dates, having a sniff check, and looking at/in it.

    Afterwards, you can {b}Keep{/b} it in your fridge,{p}or {b}Toss{/b} the item out.

    By default, you will {b}Keep{/b} an item.{p}If you think an item went bad, {b}Toss{/b} them.

    Though who knows?{p}{i}Maybe there is some other household uses for them.{/i}

    If you decide to {b}Keep{/b} in the fridge, you can always {b}Check{/b} it again...{p}{i}and {b}Toss{/b} if you changed your mind{/i}.
